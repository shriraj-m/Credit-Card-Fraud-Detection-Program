Architecture
Data Ingestion:
Collect and preprocess transaction data for real-time predictions.

Fraud Detection Models:

Train the XGBoost and PyTorch models and deploy them as inference services.
Include ensemble logic (e.g., majority voting or weighted scores) to combine the predictions.
Explainability Engine:
Use SHAP to generate feature attributions for each prediction.

LLM-Generated Reports:

Integrate an LLM for generating human-readable explanations.
Use PyTorch or Hugging Face Transformers for the LLM implementation.
API Deployment:

Containerize the app using Docker.
Serve the API via FastAPI or Flask.
Client Dashboard (Optional):
A simple web interface for viewing fraud detection results and explainable insights.
